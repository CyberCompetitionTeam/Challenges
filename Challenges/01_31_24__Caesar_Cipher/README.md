Part 1:
  1. Reverse a string
  2. Insert a character into the string
  3. Delete a character in the string

ie, "A brown dog" becomes "god nworb A", next I insert "!" in the original string at a specific index and it becomes "A brown dog!", next I remove "!" from the original string and it becomes "A brown dog".

Part 2: 
Create a Caesar Cipher (ROT13). A user should be able to insert a string to be ROT13 encoded, 
and should be able to enter a ROT13 encoded string to be decoded. 
If you want, you can give the user the option to control the Shift Cipher 
(Caesar Cipher is a type of Shift Cipher that rotates the letter by 13 so A->N, B->O, C->P, and so on).
