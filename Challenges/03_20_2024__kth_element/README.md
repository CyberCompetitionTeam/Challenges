Given an array arr[] of size N and a number K, where K is smaller than the size of the array. 
Find the Kâ€™th smallest element in the given array. Given that all array elements are distinct.

Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, K = 3 
Output: 7

Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, K = 4 
Output: 10 

For this challenge, think about the most effiecent solution. When coding, try an intial brute
force solution, then look to see how you can get a faster solution. Inefficient code is fine
for small projects, but can cause issues when the scope or scale of the computations increases.
